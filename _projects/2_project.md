After completing my PhD, I joined [Dr. Stuart McDaniel's group](https://mcdaniellab.biology.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida as a postdoc.
The goal of my postdoctoral project was to study rapidly changing Arctic ecosystems, focusing particularly on mosses, their microbiomes, and function. Why are mosses important in this context?

## Overview

My postdoctoral work was focused on investigating the roles of mosses (bryophytes) and their associated microbes in nitrogen (N) cycling within arctic tundra and boreal forest ecosystems.
**The Arctic is warming up twice as fast as rest of the world**, therefore, to understand how ecosystems will respond to climate change, Arctic is a good place to start.

Mosses are an important component of these ecosystems because they account for approximately half of the net primary productivity of these regions and drive soil organic layer C accumulation.
Additionally, **moss-associated microbes are the primary source of biologically fixed N inputs in these nitrogen-limited environments**.

Our long-term goal was to understand the ecosystem-scale consequences of climate change on community assembly and function and how this impacts biodiversity.
**We focused on how moss population genetics and species diversity shape the assembly and function of the moss microbiome**,
particularly the N-fixing microbiomes of feather mosses **_Hylocomium splendens_** and **_Pleurozium schreberi_**.

Additionally, we studied the evolutionary history of the genus **_Aulacomnium_**, an under-studied, yet an important contributor to the function of these ecosystems. 
**_Aulacomnium_** was selected as a study system owing to some key findings from our group's previous work. We had observed that closely related species within this genus support distinct microbiome
 communities. This characteristic makes **_Aulacomnium_** a valuable model for identifying specific genetic variants that influence microbiome assembly,
 particularly in the context of gene flow between species.

## Evolutionary history of the genus, **_Aulacomnium_**

Thos research project focused on the species within the **_Aulacomnium_** genus. Using ddRADseq and target capture sequencing data, we investigated the phylogenetic and population genetic relationships 
within this ecologically significant group of bryophytes in the Arctic. Specifically, we investigated three closely related species: **_Aulacomnium palustre_**, **_A. turgidum_**, and **_A. acuminatum_**.
**_A. palustre_** exhibits a broad distribution, ranging from temperate forests to arctic tundra, while **_A. turgidum_** and **_A. acuminatum_** are sympatric with **_A. palustre_** in 
sub-arctic and arctic zones.

Our primary objectives regarding **_Aulacomnium_** were:
- To test the hypothesis that **_A. acuminatum_** is a hybrid species resulting from the hybridization of **_A. palustre_** and **_A. turgidum**
- To determine whether there is ongoing gene flow among these species in sympatric populations.

## Key findings

- [All studied moss species (34 species) hosted N-fixing bacteria.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-020-00534-3). Moss-associated N fixation is often the largest source of new N to Arctic ecosystems
- [Both host species and host evolutionary history predicted moss microbiome composition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40168-021-01001-4). Nitrogen fixation rates also varied by host species across 26 boreal and tundra moss species across 24 sites in Alaska.
- [Moss host species explained more of the variation in microbiome composition than the collection site.](https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14288)
- Despite the broad sympatry among the members of the **_Aulacomnium_** genus, the morphologically defined species remain genetically distinct, and there was no evidence of hybrid speciation. (unpublished)

    Collecting moss samples in the Arctic. We used these samples to conduct three types of experiments at three different labs: molecular analysis to investigate moss host genetics at the University of Florida, microbiome analysis at the University of Colorado, and measurements of N fixation with stable isotopes at the University of Northern Arizona. My responsibilities included generating ddRADseq and target capture sequencing data from these samples and conducting population genetic and phylogenetic data analysis.

## Project contributions

- Collected and processed ~600 moss samples (**_Aulacomnium_** and **_Hylocomium_** spp.)for DNA extraction and constructed NGS libraries (ddRADseq) for Illumina sequencing.
- Built bioinformatic pipelines to process ddRADseq data and conduct downstream population genetic (e.g. STRUCTURE, Treemix) and phylogenetic (RAxML) analysis.
- Developed bioinformatic pipelines for processing taget-capture sequencing data generated from the GoFlag408 probe set. Conducted phylogenetic analysis (RAxML, ASTRAL), and assessed gene tree discordance and hybridization events (IQ-TREE, DENSITREE, PhyParts, PhyloNetworks).
- Successfully constructed a well-supported phylogeny of the moss genus **_Aulacomnium_** using phylogenomic analyses of 399 targeted nuclear loci from the GoFlag408 probe se


I often say that, when it comes to rapidly changing Arctic eco-systems, **mosses are tiny, but mighty**! 
It is important to remember that **mosses and their microbiomes are an important piece of the puzzle of predicting how Arctic ecosystems will respond to continued climate change.**
