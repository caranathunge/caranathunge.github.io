After completing my PhD, I joined [Dr. Stuart McDaniel's group](https://mcdaniellab.biology.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida as a postdoc.
The goal of my postdoctoral project was to study rapidly changing Arctic ecosystems, focusing particularly on mosses, their microbiomes, and function. Why are mosses important in this context?

## Overview

My postdoctoral work was focused on investigating the roles of mosses (bryophytes) and their associated microbes in nitrogen (N) cycling within arctic tundra and boreal forest ecosystems.
**The Arctic is warming up twice as fast as rest of the world**, therefore, to understand how ecosystems will respond to climate change, it was a good place to start.
Mosses are an important component of these ecosystems because they account for approximately half of the net primary productivity of these regions and drive soil organic layer C accumulation.
Additionally, **moss-associated microbes are the primary source of biologically fixed N inputs in these nitrogen-limited environments**.
Our long-term goal was to understand the ecosystem-scale consequences of climate change on community assembly and function and how this impacts biodiversity.
**We focused on how moss population genetics and species diversity shape the assembly and function of the moss microbiome**,
particularly the N-fixing microbiomes of feather mosses **_Hylocomium splendens_** and **_Pleurozium schreberi_**.
Additionally, we studied the evolutionary history of the genus **_Aulacomnium_**, an under-studied, yet an important contributor to the function of these ecosystems.

Our truck, a tiny speck by the roadside, shows how far up we had had to climb to collect the samples.

    Collecting moss samples in the Arctic. We used these samples to conduct three types of experiments at three different labs: molecular analysis to investigate moss host genetics at the University of Florida, microbiome analysis at the University of Colorado, and measurements of N fixation with stable isotopes at the University of Northern Arizona. My responsibilities included generating ddRADseq and target capture sequencing data from these samples and conducting population genetic and phylogenetic data analysis.
